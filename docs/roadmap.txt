Wildflower Roadmap
******************

1. Finish all the sections of the admin interface.
    - Dashboard
    - Blog (60% done)
    - Pages (20%)
    - Comments
    - User Accounts
    - Site Settings
    
2. Hooks all around the system & plugin architecture for extending Wildflower functionality, without hacking the original files.    
    
3. Post/Page saving and staging: Ability to edit and save the post/page without publishing the new changes. The latest published revision is visible to the public.

4. Integrate Cake's AuthComponent to manage user auth.
