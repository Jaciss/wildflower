A simple, easy, AJAXY, solution for managing your access control lists.
Introduction
It has been done before. I believe both Mariano Iglesias (mariano_iglesias) and Andy Dawson (ad7six) have both created ACL plugins. But unfortunately, at the time of this writing, neither of them worked for me. So I decided to create an AJAX ACL plugin. I needed one for my current project, plus I wanted to contribute something else to CakePHP outside of the crappy Oracle DBO that I wrote a year ago; and writing a fancy new plugin is way more fun that writing data import scripts and reports for my boss.

Before I waste too much of your time, you're welcome to check out a demo here:

If you're still with me, then I can explain how you can get this puppy working for yourself.

Requirements:

    * PHP 4 or 5
    * CakePHP 1.2 Beta
    * ACL Plugin - svn://newnewmedia.com/cakephp/plugins/acl
    * Prototype 1.5.1.1 - http://www.prototypejs.org/assets/2007/6/20/prototype.js
    * Tango Icon Library - http://tango-project.org/releases/tango-icon-theme-0.8.1.tar.gz

Instructions for Installation
Note: At the time of this writing, CakePHP has no way of bundling images/css/js within the plugin. So if you want this thing to look pretty, you're going to have to do a little extra work.

   1. Download Prototype, drop the file directly into /app/webroot/js
   2. Download Tango Icon Library, name the folder 'tango', and put it in /app/webroot/img
   3. Checkout the ACL plugin source from svn and put the 'acl' folder in /app/plugins
   4. edit your core.php and turn on admin routing
   5. Browse to the address /admin/acl


That's it! The ACL management plugin should be installed. Usage instructions are built into the plugin, so I do not have to go on at length about it here.
